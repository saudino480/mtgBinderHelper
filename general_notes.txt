Set Specific Interactions:
	- STA JPN cards start after collector number 63
	- 10E Foils are technically different cards (have the ★ marker) (only set to do this)
	- WAR JPN planeswalkers have the ★ in the number, can be foil or non-foil
	- all promo sets start with P, have the ★

	- Any set with Multiple Arts for single collector code (ZEN, ZNR, legacy sets)
	  will always follow the 249/249a/249b etc naming convention



Data Documentation Scratchwork:

cardInfo:
	- legality is a 12-bit integer where each bit represents whether it is legal in that format. Here is Force of Will:
		0001110000 -> Standard, Pioneer, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, Commander, Pauper, Penny, Alchemy, Explorer, Historic, Brawl
		Easier than storing the information in 12 additional 2-bit columns.

		Do I care about bannings? Maybe manually label the card? So few cards are banned...

	- colors will be stored as a string; it will be WUBRG, or C if no colors.
	- Nones are typically representitive of either:
		- oracle: No text in the textbox.
		- hasFoil/hasNonFoil: Does not have the relevant category
		- manaCost: No written manacost (ex: Living End)
