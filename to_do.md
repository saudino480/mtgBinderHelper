Things to still do:

- Finish the connector between the echoMTG db and the AllCards or w/e
- Shuffling things to clean up; create UI


All of these things are dependant on the above:
- Add option to pull new values / new inventory
- Add option to just pull price based on the cards I am looking at in my inventory.
- Set aside cards under and over \$1.


At the end:
- Run through and properly comment / document
