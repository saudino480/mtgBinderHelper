Things to still do:

Main work:

[X] Connect echoMTG to price data and set number
[ ] Migrate all functions to .py files
[ ] Start to build out SQL dbs to store data in a better way
[ ] Begin to figure out how to display the information desired
    - These would be...
        [ ] Cards under a dollar
        [ ] Weeks under a dollar
        [ ] Cards newly over a dollar
        [ ] Weeks over a dollar


Extras:

[ ] Add option to only pull data we don't have from https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/ (we can wait until September until Brother's War to implement this)
[ ] Add option to pull subset of data (this will be important once I am managing more ~$1 cards)


All of these things are dependant on the above:
- Add option to pull new values / new inventory
- Add option to just pull price based on the cards I am looking at in my inventory.
- Set aside cards under and over \$1.


At the end:
- Run through and properly comment / document
