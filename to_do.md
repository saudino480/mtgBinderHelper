Things to still do:

- Get actual prices of cards. (this will be handled by the Scryfall API) <- this is more problematic than I thought; will have to figure out how to collect the actual collector number


All of these things are dependant on the above:
- Add option to pull new values / new inventory
- Add option to just pull price based on the cards I am looking at in my inventory.
- Set aside cards under and over \$1.
